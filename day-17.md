Learning Journal
Day 17

Today my team an I made some great progress. We have the js working really good.
We are able to complete a full round of the matching game, but we do not quite have
multiple rounds yet. I was able to design some custom game cards and format the pictures
to 200 x 200 px so that none of the images are distored or stretched. We are not too far away from 
the half-way point maybe even pass. The game plan is to create multiple rounds for tomorrow.
