Day 10

The more I review my code the easier it is to understand whats going on on in javascript.
I plan to continue to put more focus into javascript because I believe in functionality over 
presentation. Eventhough I believe that both are very important, if the product does not work
then there cannot be a happy customer. I was able to get the my script working properly and it 
felt wonderful. My mistakes are becoming more of typos vs. lack of understanding which make me 
Excited to learn more.
