#Learning Journal - Day 2

I learned about the terminal, and how to execute an ACP command. Within this context I was taught how to connect the git with github.
More importantly I was able to learn more about front-end design. Design is my strong point and learning how to design the same way I would with a graphic design program is exciting. I had a one hour sleep night last night but I am pumped and ready for class today.
