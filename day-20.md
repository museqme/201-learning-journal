201 Learning Journal
Day 20

  Presentation day was great. The entire 201 was a great experience. Our project recieved a good response to from the audience. We did 
experience some technical difficulty at the 2nd round of our game. Our team did a great job at solving the problem by restarting the game.
I plan to continue my javascript skills over the break by redoing our projects and doing more readings about javascript.
