201 Learning Journal
Day 13

Its been another fasted paced week. The jargon of javascript is starting to make more sense. It is becoming
easier to both listen to a problem and talk my way through a problem in the correct terminology.
Even as the logic continues to become easier, the more stuff we learn informs me on the amount of work that
need to be done. My project are closer to completion and mostly just need some css add to them. I've enjoyed 
the reading and diving more into the js world.
