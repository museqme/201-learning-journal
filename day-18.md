Day 18 

Our group is getting alot of work done. I notice we work together really well. Two of us are always working on 
html/css and the other two are working on javascript. We then switch throughout the day. This works pretty fluidly. 
So far we have reached our mvp, but needs more polishing for to be a functional/ fine-tuned product.
