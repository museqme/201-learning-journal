Learning Journal 
Day - 4 

I can start feeling the pace of the class pick up quite a bit. This curriculum really 
forces us to engage in the content or we will fall behind. So far the hardest part is learning 
how to properly use the loops. I think the fact that there is so many different ways to use
the loop it can be easy to lose sight of the fundamentals of creating a loop. Javascript is 
fun, but I know it is going to be a challange and will require a lot of persistance and repetition.
at this point I would like to take a day and work on loop challanges over and over.
