Learning Journal
Day 16

As my learning continues I am learning the importance of working with speed and percision.
I am enjoying my group for the project. We all get alone and work hard. In day 1 of project week
we may be ahead of everyone else in the class. I participated in my first hackathon over the weekend, 
and it was a very good experience. I was able to do some wireframing for my team and apply some UX elements
to an app that allows users to compare workout intensity to Professional athletes.
