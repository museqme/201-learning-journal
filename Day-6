Learning Journal

  Code fellows so far has be quite a change of pace in my life. I'm learning through coding a type of skill
that requires a great deal of details and accuracy. I am beginning to pickup on the concepts of for loops
a lot better. The logic is slowly making more sense, I will put a lot most of my effort in the javascript part
this weeks project then css since javascript seems to be my challenge.
